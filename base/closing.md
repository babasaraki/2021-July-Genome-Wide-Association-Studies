# Closing Thoughts

## Be Consistent

## Prerequisites for bioinformatics

* Access to a multi-core (24 cpu or greater), ‘high’ memory 64Gb or greater Linux server.
* Familiarity with the ’command line’ and at least one programming language.
* Basic knowledge of how to install software
* Basic knowledge of R (or equivalent) and statistical programming
* Basic knowledge of Statistics and model building

## The bottom line

* Spend the time (and money) planning and producing good quality, accurate and sufficient data for your experiment.
* Get to know to your data, develop and test expectations
* Result, you’ll spend much less time (and less money) extracting biological significance and results during analysis.

## Next Steps

My recommendation is to follow all of the instructions again, from the beginning on your own and use the slack channel to ask questions or send emails to [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu). We will try be responsive to answering questions.

You'll have access to the Computing Workshop resources for an additional week, use it to repeat the workshop materials, run freebayes, deepvariant, and/or work on your own dataset. Just transfer your data to /share/workshop
